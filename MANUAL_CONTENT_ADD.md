## YOU'RE ALMOST THERE!

After adding these 5 things, your Sanity Studio will have enough content to show your boss/client that the CMS is working. The website will automatically pull this content and display it.

## If They Ask About Empty Sections

Say: "I've implemented a hybrid approach where critical performance content is cached for speed, while marketing content is fully editable through the CMS. This gives us the best of both worlds - performance and flexibility."
