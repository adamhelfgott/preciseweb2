# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Precise.ai is a privacy-preserving data collaboration platform for advertising campaigns. The platform enables:
- **Data Controllers**: Monetize data through verified credentials while maintaining privacy
- **Media Buyers**: Access high-quality audience data with transparent attribution

Key differentiators:
- Privacy-first approach - data never leaves owner's control
- Valence Enhanced Shapley for fair value distribution
- Marketing Mix Model (MMM) for media buyer attribution
- Real-time campaign optimization with AI assistance

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Start production
npm run start

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint

# Run Convex
npx convex dev
```

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Frontend**: Next.js 15 App Router for SSG/SSR capabilities
2. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development
3. **Backend**: Convex for real-time features (chat, activity feeds)
4. **AI**: Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI for chat assistant
5. **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
6. **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions

## Key Implementation Notes

### AI Assistant
- Uses Vercel AI SDK v3 with streaming responses
- Persists chat history in Convex
- Markdown rendering with react-markdown
- Collapsible UI to not obstruct main content

### Attribution Models
- **Media Buyers**: Marketing Mix Model (MMM) for campaign attribution
- **Data Controllers**: Valence Enhanced Shapley for fair value distribution
- Values are abstracted to prevent exact negotiation leverage

### Design Philosophy
- Blends Spotify's data visualization, Apple's minimalism, and HermÃ¨s' craftsmanship
- Premium neutral palette with vibrant accents
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility as a core principle

### Color Palette
- Dark Gray: #2D3436
- Medium Gray: #636E72
- Light Gray: #F5F6F7
- Silk Gray: #FAFBFC

## Important Rules

1. **No Fake Data in Production**: Never show inflated metrics or fake company logos
2. **Privacy First**: Always abstract exact data values to prevent leverage
3. **Bug Fixes**: Never remove features when fixing bugs - find the root cause
4. **Quality**: Prefer fixing existing features over adding new ones
5. **User Experience**: Always provide loading states and error handling
6. **Accessibility**: All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
7. **Performance**: Lazy load heavy components and optimize images
