# Precise: Enabling AdTech 3.0 Through Cross-Platform Intelligence

## The Company
Precise is building the infrastructure layer that enables true cross-platform advertising intelligence. Our platform creates privacy-safe, uniquely targetable cohorts derived from verified context, behavior, and emotional signals—not dependent on traditional identifiers like emails, IPs, or device IDs. This proprietary signal layer powers dynamic targeting, attribution, and optimization for brand and agency clients. With 10+ nodes already deployed across data brokers, identity graphs, and proprietary datasets, we're creating the secure foundation that allows AI-driven optimization and holistic campaign management across previously siloed platforms.

## What Brands and Agencies Actually Want
Major brands and agencies like OMD aren't asking for "proof-verified data"—they're demanding:
- **Unified command centers** that manage campaigns across CTV, digital, linear, and emerging channels from one interface
- **AI-driven budget optimization** that automatically shifts spend to highest-performing platforms in real-time
- **Cross-platform audience insights** where learnings from one channel enhance performance on others
- **Holistic attribution** that tracks customer journeys from first impression to final outcome
- **Safe data enhancement** that enriches campaigns without privacy risks

## How Precise Enables This
Our verified credential infrastructure on Alicenet is the invisible layer that makes these capabilities possible. By creating cryptographic proofs for every data transformation, we enable:
- **Secure data flow** between Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, and on-premise systems
- **Automatic royalty distribution** that incentivizes data sharing and creates new revenue streams
- **Privacy-compliant enhancement** where first-party data can safely combine with third-party insights
- **Real-time optimization signals** that feed AI models without exposing raw data

## The Business Model
- **Platform fee** (45%) on royalty flows creates recurring SaaS revenue
- **Premium tiers** for advanced AI optimization and predictive analytics
- **Network effects** as more data sources increase platform intelligence
- **Defensible moat** through proprietary cross-cloud infrastructure

## Why This Matters Now
The advertising industry is fragmenting across channels while brands and agencies demand unification. Traditional DSPs are single-channel focused. Walled gardens won't share data. Privacy regulations limit old approaches. Meanwhile, the entire data ecosystem—from broadcasters to data brokers to identity graphs—needs new monetization models as cookies deprecate. Precise's infrastructure solves all these problems, enabling MadHive and other platforms to deliver the cross-platform intelligence brands need while creating sustainable revenue for data providers. Our 10+ deployments across the data ecosystem prove the model works, while direct brand and agency engagement confirms demand for these AdTech 3.0 capabilities. The verified credentials aren't the product—they're what makes the product possible.
