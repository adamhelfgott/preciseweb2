# ðŸš¨ FIX SANITY MISSING CONTENT - RUN THIS NOW!

## The Problem
- Many Sanity content items show as "Untitled" in the Studio
- Lots of content types aren't being seeded at all
- Field name mismatches (logo vs imageUrl, etc.)

## The Quick Fix (1 Command)

```bash
cd /Users/adamhelfgott/projects/preciseweb2
./scripts/reset-sanity-fixed.sh
```

This updated script now:
1. Clears all content (removes duplicates)
2. Seeds basic content with correct field names
3. **Seeds ALL missing content types** including:
   - Navigation structure
   - Logo bars
   - CTA sections  
   - How It Works sections with **92% accuracy**
   - Page heroes
   - Process steps
   - Benefit cards
   - FAQ sections
   - Testimonials
   - Calculator section
   - Integration partners
   - Buyer personas
   - Feature benefits
   - Outcome metrics
