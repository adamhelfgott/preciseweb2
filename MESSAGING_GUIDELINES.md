# Precise Platform: Messaging Guidelines

## Core Principle
We're building a **network economy** where data providers participate in value creation, not a simple "sell your data for cash" platform.

## ❌ Avoid These Phrases
- "Earn money from your data"
- "Sell your data"
- "Get paid for your information"
- "Monetize your data assets"
- "Turn data into cash"
- "Data marketplace" (when referring to direct sales)

## ✅ Use These Instead
- "Join the Precise Network"
- "Participate in the data economy"
- "Contribute to advertising effectiveness"
- "Enable better outcomes through data collaboration"
- "Become part of the attribution network"
- "Share in the value your data helps create"
- "Participate in campaign success"

## Key Messaging Frameworks

### For Data Providers
**Primary Message**: "Join a network where your data contributions help create more effective advertising, and you participate in the value generated."

**Supporting Points**:
- You're not selling data, you're enabling better outcomes
- Attribution is based on actual contribution to success
- Fair distribution through Shapley values
- Cryptographic proof of participation
- Privacy-preserving collaboration

### For Media Buyers
**Primary Message**: "Access a network of verified data contributors that improve campaign performance through proven attribution."

**Supporting Points**:
- Performance-based pricing
- Transparent attribution
- Quality-verified sources
- Reduced CAC through better targeting
- Compliance-first approach

### For Developers
**Primary Message**: "Build on an open protocol for fair data attribution and value distribution in advertising."

## Website Copy Updates

## Legal and Compliance Considerations

### Important Distinctions
1. **Network Participation** vs. Data Sales
   - Users join a network and participate in value creation
   - Not a direct buyer-seller relationship
   - Similar to how Uber drivers participate in the ride economy

2. **Attribution Rewards** vs. Payments
   - Rewards based on proven contribution to outcomes
   - Not guaranteed income
   - Performance-based distribution

3. **Collaborative Value Creation**
   - Multiple parties contribute to success
   - Fair distribution through algorithmic attribution
   - Network governance and rules

## Onboarding Flow Updates

### Step 1: Welcome
"Welcome to Precise Network - where data providers and advertisers collaborate to create better outcomes for everyone."

### Step 2: How It Works
"When you contribute data to the network:
- Your data helps improve campaign targeting
- Shapley values calculate fair attribution
- You receive rewards based on actual impact
- Privacy and control remain with you"

### Step 3: Network Rules
"As a network participant:
- You maintain control over your data
- Contributions are cryptographically verified
- Rewards are distributed based on impact
- The network operates transparently"

## Marketing Materials

### Tagline Options
1. "The Attribution Network for Modern Advertising"
2. "Where Data Meets Fair Distribution"
3. "Participate in the Future of Advertising"
4. "The Network Economy for Data"

### Elevator Pitch
"Precise is building a network where data providers can participate in the advertising economy through fair attribution. Using Shapley values and cryptographic proofs, we ensure everyone receives their fair share of the value they help create."

## FAQs Rewrite

### Q: How do I make money?
**Old A**: "You earn money when advertisers use your data"
**New A**: "You participate in the network's value creation. When campaigns succeed using data you've contributed, you receive rewards based on your attribution score calculated through Shapley values."

### Q: Am I selling my data?
**A**: "No. You're joining a network where your data contributions help improve advertising outcomes. You maintain control and receive rewards based on the proven impact of your contributions."

### Q: Is this guaranteed income?
**A**: "Network rewards are based on actual campaign performance and your data's contribution to success. Like any network economy, value is created through participation and collaboration."

## Email Templates

### Welcome Email
Subject: "Welcome to the Precise Network"

"You've joined a revolutionary network where data providers and advertisers work together to create better outcomes for everyone. Your contributions help make advertising more effective, and you'll be rewarded based on the actual impact you create."

### First Reward Email
Subject: "Your First Network Reward"

"Congratulations! Your contributions to the Precise network have generated your first reward. This reward reflects the value your data helped create across multiple campaigns."

## Conclusion

By positioning Precise as a network economy rather than a data marketplace, we:
1. Set appropriate expectations
2. Avoid regulatory concerns
3. Emphasize collaboration over transaction
4. Build a more sustainable narrative
5. Focus on value creation, not data sales

Remember: We're building the "Airbnb for data" - a network where participants share in value creation, not a "data store" where people sell their information.
