# Why PE-Backed MadHive Needs Precise to Hit Quarterly Targets

MadHive's PE backers need consistent quarterly growth, but the traditional DSP model is hitting a ceiling. The real challenge isn't just margin compression—it's that brands and agencies like OMD are demanding capabilities MadHive can't deliver alone: unified cross-platform campaign management, AI-driven budget optimization across all channels, and holistic performance insights that span CTV, digital, and linear. More critically, they need privacy-safe targeting that doesn't rely on deteriorating identifiers like cookies or device IDs. Precise enables MadHive to deliver these AdTech 3.0 capabilities by creating behavioral cohorts from context and emotional signals—exactly what brands need in a privacy-first world. With Precise, MadHive can offer brands and agencies a true command center where AI automatically shifts budgets between platforms based on real-time performance, where behavioral insights from one channel enhance targeting on another, and where every media dollar is tracked from impression to outcome without compromising privacy. This transforms MadHive from a single-channel CTV player into a cross-platform orchestration layer powered by proprietary behavioral signals. The 10-25% CPM uplift comes from delivering superior outcomes through context-based intelligence that works when traditional identifiers fail. Combined with new revenue streams from data ecosystem royalties and reduced CAC from behavioral targeting, Precise gives MadHive the growth levers to exceed quarterly targets while building a defensible moat competitors can't match.
