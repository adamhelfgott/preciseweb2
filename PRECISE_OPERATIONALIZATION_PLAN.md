# Precise Operationalization Plan: API Integration Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the technical architecture for operationalizing Precise as the cryptographic proof layer between DSPs (like Beeswax/Stinger) and the data ecosystem, enabling real-time capture, verification, and royalty distribution.

## Core Integration Points

### 1. DSP Integration Layer (Beeswax/Stinger)
```
Key Integration Areas:
- Campaign Creation & Management
- Audience Segment Upload/Activation
- Bidding & Targeting Parameters
- Real-time Event Stream (impressions, clicks, conversions)
- Reporting & Attribution Data
```

#### Required API Endpoints to Implement:
- **Audience Ingestion**: Accept behavioral cohorts with proof badges
- **Bid Enhancement**: Inject proof metadata into bid requests
- **Event Capture**: Real-time streaming of all ad events
- **Attribution Webhook**: Conversion and outcome notifications

### 2. Precise Data Capture Layer
```
Components:
- Event Ingestion Service (Kafka/Kinesis)
- Proof Generation Engine (Rust-based for performance)
- Alicenet Writer (batched blockchain commits)
- Royalty Calculator (real-time value attribution)
```

#### Data Flow:
1. **Inbound**: DSP events → Precise Event Hub → Proof Generation
2. **Processing**: Event validation → Cohort matching → Value calculation
3. **Outbound**: Proof hash → Alicenet + Royalty ledger update

### 3. Cloud Data Connectors

#### Databricks Integration
```python
# Precise SDK for Databricks
from precise import DataProof

@proof_enabled
def transform_audience_data(df):
    # Automatic proof generation on transformation
    return df.with_column("cohort_id", 
                         generate_behavioral_cohort(df.user_signals))
```

#### Snowflake Integration
```sql
-- Precise UDF in Snowflake
CREATE FUNCTION PRECISE_MINT_PROOF(data VARIANT)
RETURNS VARIANT
AS 'com.precise.snowflake.ProofGenerator';

-- Usage in data pipeline
SELECT PRECISE_MINT_PROOF(audience_data) as proofed_audience
FROM raw_behavioral_signals;
```

#### BigQuery Integration
```sql
-- Precise stored procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE precise.mint_audience_proof(
  IN source_table STRING,
  OUT proof_id STRING,
  OUT cohort_ids ARRAY<STRING>
)
```

### 4. Real-time Services Architecture

```yaml
Services:
  proof-api:
    - POST /proof/generate
    - GET /proof/verify/{proof_id}
    - POST /proof/batch
    
  royalty-api:
    - GET /royalty/calculate/{campaign_id}
    - POST /royalty/distribute
    - GET /royalty/ledger/{provider_id}
    
  cohort-api:
    - POST /cohort/create
    - GET /cohort/{cohort_id}/performance
    - POST /cohort/enhance
```

### 5. Event Schema

```json
{
  "event_type": "impression|click|conversion|attribution",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "campaign_id": "madhive_12345",
  "cohort_id": "eco_urban_renters_10013",
  "proof_hash": "0x7d3f...",
  "metadata": {
    "dsp": "beeswax",
    "publisher": "discovery_plus",
    "geo": {"zip": "10013", "dma": "501"},
    "device": "ctv",
    "creative_id": "cr_789",
    "bid_price": 23.50,
    "clearing_price": 19.00
  },
  "attribution": {
    "data_contributors": [
      {"id": "broadcaster_x", "signal_type": "viewing_behavior", "weight": 0.3},
      {"id": "retailer_y", "signal_type": "purchase_intent", "weight": 0.5},
      {"id": "identity_graph_z", "signal_type": "household_link", "weight": 0.2}
    ]
  }
}
```

### 6. Madhive-Specific Integration

#### Maverick AI Enhancement
```javascript
// Maverick receives enhanced signals
const preciseEnhancedAudience = {
  base_audience: maverick_audience_id,
  precise_cohorts: [
    {
      id: "eco_urban_renters",
      confidence: 0.87,
      behavioral_signals: ["sustainability_affinity", "urban_mobility"],
      performance_prediction: 4.2 // ROAS
    }
  ],
  cross_platform_insights: {
    streaming_engagement: 0.76,
    linear_correlation: 0.23,
    retail_propensity: 0.89
  }
}
```

#### SmartProposal Integration
- Auto-populate proposals with proof-verified audiences
- Show predicted CPM uplift for verified cohorts
- Include cross-cloud audience availability

### 7. Security & Compliance

```yaml
Security Measures:
  - API Authentication: OAuth 2.0 + API keys
  - Data Encryption: TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest
  - PII Handling: Zero PII in proof layer, only hashed identifiers
  - Audit Trail: Every API call logged with immutable timestamp
  
Compliance:
  - GDPR: Right to deletion honored via proof invalidation
  - CCPA: Consumer opt-out propagated to all systems
  - SOC2: Annual audit of security controls
```

### 8. Performance Requirements

```yaml
Latency Targets:
  - Proof Generation: <50ms per event
  - Batch Processing: 100K events/second
  - API Response: <100ms p99
  - Royalty Calculation: Real-time (<5 min delay)
  
Scale Requirements:
  - 10B+ events/day across all DSPs
  - 100M+ unique cohorts
  - 10K+ API calls/second peak
```

### 9. Monitoring & Analytics

```yaml
Dashboards:
  - Real-time event flow by DSP
  - Proof generation success rate
  - Royalty accrual by data provider
  - API latency and error rates
  - Cohort performance metrics
  
Alerts:
  - Proof generation failures >1%
  - API latency >200ms
  - Royalty calculation delays >10min
  - Suspicious activity patterns
```
