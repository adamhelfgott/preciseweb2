# Precise.ai App Audit Report

## üö® Critical Issues (Fix Before Cannes)

### 1. Missing Core Pages
These pages are linked but don't exist:

#### Developer Section
- `/developers` - Main developer hub (linked from nav)
- `/developers/api` - API reference (linked from footer)
- `/developers/sdks` - SDK downloads (linked from footer)  
- `/developers/examples` - Code examples (linked from footer)

#### Company Section  
- `/about` - About us page (linked from footer)
- `/blog` - Blog/resources (linked from footer)
- `/careers` - Job openings (linked from footer)
- `/security` - Security & compliance (linked from footer)

#### Other Missing
- `/demo` - Live demo (linked from agent-intelligence page)
- `/contact` - Contact form (linked from CTAs)
- `/support` - Support center (linked from footer)
- `/partners` - Partner program (linked from footer)
- `/trust-center` - Privacy hub (linked from footer)

### 2. Broken Image References

#### Case Studies Page
```tsx
// Line 44-46 in case-studies/page.tsx
// src: "/images/case-studies/chicago-cubs.jpg", 
// src: "/images/case-studies/retail.jpg",
// src: "/images/case-studies/streaming.jpg",
```
These images don't exist and cause broken image icons.

#### Company Page
Team photos reference external domain that doesn't exist:
```tsx
photo: "https://precise.ai/static/img/photo/adam.jpg"
```

### 3. Navigation Inconsistencies

**Main Nav**: "For intelligence users"  
**Footer**: "For advertisers"  
These should match - recommend using "For advertisers" everywhere.

### 4. Broken Links

#### Contact Page
- "Live chat" button links to `#`
- "Schedule a demo" links to `#`

#### Pricing Page  
- References privacy policy without proper link
- Enterprise contact form doesn't submit anywhere

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Content Issues

### 1. Compliance Page Contradictions
- Says "GDPR compliant" but no actual certification shown
- Claims "SOC2 certified" without proof
- No actual compliance badges or audit reports

### 2. How It Works Page
- Step 3 mentions "verified credentials" but this isn't explained elsewhere
- Data flow diagram would be helpful but is missing

### 3. Case Studies
- All case studies show unrealistic metrics (400%+ improvements)
- No actual client logos or testimonials
- Consider more believable numbers

## üí° Quick Fixes (30 minutes)

### 1. Create Redirect Pages
Create simple pages that redirect or show "Coming Soon":

```tsx
// app/developers/page.tsx
export default function DevelopersPage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
      <div className="text-center">
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Developer Portal Coming Soon</h1>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Our comprehensive developer resources are launching soon.
        </p>
        <Link href="/docs/api" className="btn-primary">
          View API Docs
        </Link>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Fix Navigation Labels
Change "For intelligence users" to "For advertisers" in Navigation.tsx

### 3. Add Missing Images
Either add placeholder images or remove the broken references entirely

### 4. Fix Contact Links
Point to a simple contact form or email address

## üìã Recommended Priority

### Must Fix Before Demo:
1. Create `/developers` page (redirect to API docs)
2. Create `/demo` page (redirect to contact)
3. Fix case study images (remove or add placeholders)
4. Fix navigation inconsistency

### Should Fix If Time:
1. Create `/about` page with company info
2. Create `/contact` with working form
3. Add real compliance badges
4. Fix team photo URLs

### Can Wait Until After Cannes:
1. Blog functionality
2. Careers page
3. Full developer portal
4. Partner program details

## üéØ The "Good Enough" Solution

For Cannes, create a single catch-all page for missing routes:

```tsx
// app/[...slug]/page.tsx
export default function ComingSoonPage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-b from-gray-50 to-white pt-32 px-4">
      <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto text-center">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Coming Soon</h1>
        <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8">
          This section is under construction. We're working hard to bring you amazing content.
        </p>
        <div className="flex gap-4 justify-center">
          <Link href="/" className="btn-primary">Back to Home</Link>
          <Link href="/get-started" className="btn-secondary">Get Started</Link>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This ensures no 404 errors during demos while maintaining professional appearance.

## ‚úÖ What's Working Well

- Core user flows (media buyer & data owner) work perfectly
- AI assistant integration is smooth
- Campaign dashboard with images looks professional
- Agent Intelligence page is compelling
- API documentation is clean and complete
- Privacy-first messaging is consistent

## üöÄ Final Recommendation

Focus on the critical path for demos:
1. Homepage ‚Üí Agent Intelligence ‚Üí Get Started ‚Üí Dashboard
2. Ensure this flow has zero broken links
3. Everything else can show "Coming Soon"

The app is 90% ready. These fixes will make it 100% demo-ready without revealing it's not fully built out.
