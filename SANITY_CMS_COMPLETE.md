# ‚úÖ Sanity CMS Integration Complete

## üéØ Current Status

Your Sanity CMS is now fully integrated and operational! Here's what we've accomplished:

### 1. **Sanity Setup** ‚úÖ
- Installed and configured Sanity with your project
- Project ID: `qjy49msn`
- Dataset: `production`
- Studio accessible at: http://localhost:3000/studio (or port 3001)

### 2. **Content Schemas Created** ‚úÖ
All necessary schemas have been created:
- `heroSection` - Hero sections for each page
- `valueProposition` - Value props for buyers/sellers
- `navigationLink` - Navigation menu items
- `pageContent` - Generic page content sections
- `teamMember` - Team member profiles
- `featureBenefit` - Feature benefits
- `buyerPersona` - Buyer personas (schema ready, no content yet)
- `outcomeMetric` - Outcome metrics (schema ready, no content yet)

### 3. **Content Seeded** ‚úÖ
All marketing content has been migrated to Sanity:
- 3 Hero sections (Home, Data Owners, Advertisers)
- 2 Value proposition sets (Media Buyers, Data Sellers)
- 6 Navigation links
- 2 Page content sections
- 11 Team members
- 4 Feature benefits

### 4. **CMS-Connected Components** ‚úÖ
All major marketing components now fetch from Sanity:
- `HeroSectionWithCMS` - Hero sections with fallback
- `NavigationWithCMS` - Navigation menu
- `ValuePropsSectionWithCMS` - Value propositions
- `TeamSectionWithCMS` - Team members
- `CTASectionWithCMS` - Call-to-action sections
- And many more...

### 5. **Fallback Pattern** ‚úÖ
All components implement a fallback pattern:
- If Sanity data loads ‚Üí Shows CMS content
- If Sanity fails ‚Üí Shows hardcoded content
- Site always works, even without CMS

## üöÄ How to Use

### Managing Content

1. **Access Sanity Studio**:
   ```bash
   # If on port 3000:
   http://localhost:3000/studio
   
   # If on port 3001:
   http://localhost:3001/studio
   
   # Direct access:
   https://qjy49msn.sanity.studio/
   ```

2. **Edit Content**:
   - Log in with your Sanity account
   - Navigate to any document type
   - Make changes and publish
   - Changes appear instantly on the site

3. **Add New Content**:
   - Click "Create new" in Studio
   - Fill in the fields
   - Publish when ready

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start development (includes Sanity)
npm run dev

# Seed/reset content
npm run seed:sanity

# Run the fixed seed script
npx tsx scripts/seed-sanity-content-fixed.ts

# Test Sanity connection
npx tsx scripts/verify-sanity-content.ts
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Client-Side Rendering
The CMS components use `"use client"` directive, which means:
- Content loads after the initial page render
- You'll see a brief flash of fallback content
- This is normal and ensures fast initial page loads

### To Convert to SSR (Optional)
If you want server-side rendering for instant content:
1. Remove `"use client"` from components
2. Use `groq` directly in page components
3. Fetch data in server components

Example:
```tsx
// In page.tsx (server component)
import { client } from '@/sanity/lib/client';
import { heroSectionQuery } from '@/sanity/lib/queries';

export default async function Page() {
  const hero = await client.fetch(heroSectionQuery);
  return <HeroSection data={hero} />;
}
```

## üìù Content Structure

### Hero Sections
```json
{
  "page": "Home",
  "headline": "Verified Activation for Modern Marketing",
  "title": "Verified Activation",
  "highlightedText": "for Modern Marketing",
  "description": "Where trusted data meets...",
  "primaryCTA": { "text": "Get Started", "href": "/get-started" },
  "secondaryCTA": { "text": "Learn More", "href": "/how-it-works" }
}
```

### Value Propositions
```json
{
  "section": "media-buyer",
  "headline": "For Media Buyers",
  "props": [
    {
      "title": "Beyond CAC",
      "description": "Drive outcomes...",
      "icon": "TrendingUp",
      "gradient": "from-blue-500 to-blue-600"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Content Not Showing?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Sanity token is set in `.env.local`
3. Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
4. Check Studio has published content

### Studio Not Loading?
1. Try different port (3000 vs 3001)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check console for errors
4. Verify project ID matches

## üéâ You're All Set!

Your Sanity CMS is fully integrated and ready to use. The site will continue to work perfectly even if Sanity is down, thanks to the fallback pattern.

**Next Steps**:
1. Add remaining content for buyer personas and outcome metrics
2. Train your team on using Sanity Studio
3. Consider adding preview mode for draft content
4. Set up webhooks for cache invalidation

## üîí Security Note

Remember to:
- Keep your `SANITY_API_TOKEN` secret
- Use read-only tokens in production
- Set up CORS policies in Sanity
- Review Sanity's security best practices
