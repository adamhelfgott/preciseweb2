# Precise.ai Team Feedback Analysis
**Date**: May 27, 2025  
**Source**: 84-slide feedback deck from team

## Executive Summary

The team has provided comprehensive feedback on both the marketing website and app. The core strategic shift is moving from "Data Owner/Media Buyer" terminology to focus on **Data Verification & Proof** as the central value proposition. This positions Precise as a technology layer for data validation rather than a data broker.

## üéØ Critical Strategic Updates

### 1. User Terminology & Positioning (Slides 1-4)

**CRITICAL CHANGE**: Reframe user categories:

- **Data Controller** (formerly Data Owner) = Declared Data Brokers (Audience Acuity, BDEX, Equifax)
  - Want: Immutable proof, provenance transparency, lineage of usage, attributed performance value (LCV), verification of activation, and accounting
  - NOT brands trying to monetize their data (legal complications)

- **Media Buyer** = Demand Platforms / Agencies / Brands
  - Want: Closed-loop intelligence, validated privacy-safe data, campaign optimization, ROI, most-valuable audience insights, data mix efficiency

- **Brand Data Owner** = Brands who can activate first-party data through demand platforms
  - Note: Syndicating data for broader use may require them to operate as declared data broker

- **Publisher** = Create private networks and data collaboration for advertisers
  - Note: May not be priority for MadHive

**Revenue Model**: Licensing fee by volume (avoids "data broker" positioning)

### 2. Core Messaging Focus

Move from "monetize data" to:
- **Data Verification & Proof**
- **Immutable lineage tracking**
- **Performance attribution**
- **Compliant infrastructure**
- **Closed-loop intelligence**

## üì± App UX/UI Updates

### Dashboard & Navigation

1. **Data Controller Dashboard** (Slide 2)
   - Add flow for login experience showing:
     - Track segment usage
     - Validate consent
     - Return path intelligence
     - Automated accounting via proof logs
   - Show real-time:
     - Return path data
     - Audience contribution scores
     - Platform demand pull audit
   - Track value by segment, partner, and campaign

2. **Media Buyer Dashboard** (Slide 3)
   - Views broken out by brand with aggregated rollup
   - Scored and proof-verified segments
   - Attribution tracking
   - Segment contribution optimization
   - Cohort-level value tracking over time

### Feature Additions

1. **Verification System**
   - Proof logs for all transactions
   - Immutable audit trail
   - Consent validation tracking
   - Usage lineage visualization

2. **Analytics Enhancements**
   - LCV (Lifetime Customer Value) attribution
   - Segment performance scoring
   - Return path intelligence
   - Real-time demand monitoring

## üåê Marketing Website Updates

### Key User Stories to Highlight (Slide 10)

**DSP User Stories**:
1. "I want to create a 'proofed' private network for my partners and clients to collaborate with 1P data and 3rd Party data to create custom audience segments with privacy-preserving and auditable data lineage"
2. "I want to have a unified view into campaign performance and data utilization so that I can track and determine contribution value"
3. "I want to leverage Precise network learnings and AI models to create optimized audience segments for my marketplace and grow my revenue and rev share back to contributed partners"

**Key Value**: 
- Proofed Data gives DSPs more trusted and differentiated status
- Federated Intelligence enables better insights for cost efficiencies

### Website Feedback (Slides 20, 40)

1. **How It Works Page** (Slide 20)
   - Question: "Would this enable return path data with the DSPs to be shared with Precise since the media buyer is enabling or do we need other permissions from the DSP?"
   - Question: "If the media buyer wants to create custom audience segments for the campaign, where is that articulated on the Website. Or are we assuming that the media buyer would do that with the DSP?"

2. **Advertisers Page** (Slide 40)
   - Update "Privacy-preserving intelligence at scale" section
   - Ensure cryptographic proof messaging is clear
   - Emphasize "No raw data joins, only verified signals"

### Homepage Messaging

1. **Hero Section**
   - Lead with data verification & proof
   - Remove "monetize your data" language
   - Focus on compliance and transparency

2. **Value Props**
   - For Data Controllers: "Compliant infrastructure for declared data brokers"
   - For Media Buyers: "Closed-loop intelligence with verified data"
   - For Brands: "Activate first-party data safely"

### New Content Needs

1. **Data Controller Page**
   - Case studies: Audience Acuity, BDEX, Equifax examples
   - Compliance documentation
   - Technical verification specs
   - Add clear flow showing login experience

2. **Media Buyer Page**
   - ROI calculators with attribution
   - Segment performance demos
   - Integration guides for DSPs
   - Clarify custom audience creation process

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Backend Requirements

1. **Proof System**
   - Blockchain or immutable ledger for lineage
   - Consent management integration
   - Real-time usage tracking

2. **Attribution Engine**
   - LCV calculation models
