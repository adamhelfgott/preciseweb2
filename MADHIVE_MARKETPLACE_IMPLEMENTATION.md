# MadHive Data Marketplace 2.0 Implementation Plan
**Powered by Precise.ai**

## 🎯 Strategic Overview

This is a perfect example of "Verified Activation" - every product delivers business outcomes with proof. It's not about data verification for compliance; it's about intelligence that drives results.

### Key Insight
MadHive doesn't need another data marketplace. They need an **Intelligence Marketplace** where every product directly impacts campaign performance and can prove it.
