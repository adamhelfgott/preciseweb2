# Precise and Verified Credentials: Enabling Infrastructure for Cross-Cloud Intelligence

Precise's cryptographic proof layer on Alicenet serves as the invisible infrastructure that makes AdTech 3.0 business models possible. Think of it as the plumbing that allows data to flow safely between Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, and on-premise systems without the traditional risks or limitations. The verified credentials aren't the productâ€”they're what enables the product: privacy-safe cohorts built from context, behavior, and emotional signals rather than emails or device IDs. By cryptographically sealing every data transformation, Precise creates the trust foundation that allows advertisers to build uniquely targetable audiences without traditional identifiers, track outcomes across the entire customer journey, and enhance campaigns with behavioral insights from multiple sources without privacy concerns. This infrastructure layer transforms isolated behavioral signals into actionable, cross-cloud intelligence that brands, agencies, and the entire data ecosystem can use to optimize spend in real-time, creating a proprietary signal layer that powers dynamic targeting and attribution beyond the limits of cookie-based advertising.
