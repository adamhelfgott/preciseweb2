# Product Requirements Document: MadHive Marketplace Integration

## Overview

The MadHive Marketplace is a data intelligence product catalog that enables broadcasters and advertisers to access outcome-based data products through the intersection of MadHive's CTV/streaming infrastructure and Precise's privacy-preserving data collaboration network.

## Product Context

### MadHive Network
- Connected TV (CTV) and streaming advertising infrastructure
- First-party data from broadcasters and streaming platforms
- Existing integrations with DSPs and measurement partners
- Focus on local broadcast and regional media companies

### Precise Network
- Privacy-preserving data collaboration platform
- Federated learning infrastructure that keeps data at source
- Cryptographic verification of data usage and attribution
- Valence-based fair value distribution for data contributors

### Intersection Value
The marketplace exists at the intersection where:
- MadHive provides the advertising delivery and measurement infrastructure
- Precise provides the privacy-preserving data collaboration layer
- Together they enable verified, outcome-based data products

- Identifies geographic optimization opportunities
- Tracks local market dynamics

**Technical Implementation:**
- Integrates with MadHive's geo-targeting
- Aggregates performance by region
- Respects privacy thresholds

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. Data remains in original systems (MadHive, broadcaster, third-party)
2. Precise enables federated queries across systems
3. Only aggregated insights and scores are returned
4. Cryptographic proofs verify all operations

### Integration Points
- MadHive CTV/streaming infrastructure
- Precise federated learning network
- Third-party measurement APIs
- DSP activation endpoints

### Privacy & Security
