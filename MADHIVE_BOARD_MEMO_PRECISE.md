# MEMORANDUM

**From:** Spencer Potts, CEO  
**To:** Madhive Board of Directors  
**Re:** Strategic Investment in Precise - Critical Infrastructure for Maverick & AdTech 3.0

## 📍 Recommendation

Minority investment in Precise, the infrastructure company enabling cryptographically-verified audience creation, attribution, and cross-cloud data orchestration for AdTech 3.0.

## 💡 Why Now

**Client Pull:** OMD and Tier-1 agencies are demanding these capabilities TODAY. They've specifically asked Madhive to deliver proof-based, cross-platform orchestration.

**Market Reality:** DSP margins compressing 200+ bps annually. Winners will have:
- Verifiable behavioral audiences (not cookies)
- AI-native cross-cloud orchestration
- Real-time optimization on outcome signals

**Innovation Imperative:** Without Precise's infrastructure, Maverick becomes just another AI feature. With it, Maverick becomes the industry's first truly intelligent orchestration layer.

## 🚀 Value Creation

| Driver | Impact |
|--------|---------|
| **CPM Premium** | +10-25% for verified audiences |
| **New Revenue** | 2% rail fee + performance-based value sharing |
| **Maverick Enhancement** | Cross-cloud signals make every AI decision smarter |
| **Competitive Moat** | Cryptographic trust layer competitors can't replicate |

## 💸 Investment Structure

- **Minority stake** with board observer rights
- **Pre-negotiated path** to majority control based on performance milestones
- **Structured to maintain innovation focus**—learning from other adtech infrastructure plays that devolved into service businesses, this investment preserves founder-led product vision aligned with our long-term transformation goals

## 🔚 The Choice

**Without Precise:** Maverick remains a powerful but limited CTV tool. We compete on features that others will copy.

**With Precise:** Maverick becomes the orchestration layer for all of advertising. We own the rails while others argue about the trains.

**The Risk:** Other adtech veterans are building similar infrastructure. First-mover advantage expires in 6 months.

This isn't an investment in technology—it's an investment in category leadership.
