# Precise.ai Go-Live Report
*Date: May 25, 2025*

## Executive Summary

The Precise.ai platform is functionally complete with all major features implemented. However, several content pages and improvements are needed before the Cannes Lions presentation.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Go-Live)

### 1. Missing Content Pages
- **Pricing Page**: Currently shows "under construction" â†’ Replace with contact form
- **How It Works Page**: Currently shows "under construction" â†’ Need content
- **Legal Pages**: No Privacy Policy or Terms of Service
- **Contact/Support Page**: Missing entirely

### 2. Case Studies Images
The case studies page references 3 images that don't exist:
- `/case-studies/chicago-cubs.jpg`
- `/case-studies/retail.jpg`
- `/case-studies/streaming.jpg`

**Solution**: Either add placeholder images or remove image references

### 3. Demo vs Production Data
All data is currently mocked. Need to either:
- Clearly mark as "Demo" throughout the platform
- Or integrate with real APIs before launch
