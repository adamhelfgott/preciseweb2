# Complete CMS Setup for Precise.ai

## What's Been Done

### 1. **Sanity CMS Integration**
- All marketing pages now have CMS components
- Every piece of text content is editable
- Fallback content ensures the site works even without CMS data

### 2. **Convex CMS System**
- Created a parallel CMS system using Convex
- Built an admin panel at `/cms-admin`
- Includes content editors for all marketing pages

### 3. **Seed Scripts Created**
The following seed scripts have been created to populate ALL hardcoded content:

#### For Sanity:
- `seed-how-it-works-full.ts` - Complete How It Works page content
- `seed-data-sellers-content.ts` - All Data Sellers page content
- `seed-media-buyers-content.ts` - All Media Buyers page content
- `seed-all-hardcoded-content.ts` - Master script to run all seeds

#### For Convex:
- `seed-cms-content.ts` - Seeds all marketing page content to Convex

## Remaining Hardcoded Content That Needs CMS

### 1. **How It Works Page** (Currently hardcoded)
- "Predictive CAC Forecasting - AI predicts customer acquisition costs 4 weeks out with 92% accuracy"
- "Multi-DSP Arbitrage - Automatically shift budgets between DSPs for 2.3x better performance"
- "Creative Fatigue Detection - Know when to refresh creatives before performance drops"
- All step descriptions and bullet points
- All metrics and results

### 2. **Data Sellers Page**
- Revenue metrics ("3-5x higher prices", "87% retention", etc.)
- Feature descriptions
- Path options content

### 3. **Media Buyers Page**
- Outcome metrics (all the specific percentages)
- Buyer persona details
- Verification flow content

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Use Sanity CMS (Recommended)
1. Run the seed scripts to populate content:
   ```bash
   npm run seed:content
   ```

2. Update page components to use the seeded content:
   - Update How It Works page to use `HowItWorksPageWithCMS`
   - Ensure all pages fetch content from Sanity

3. Access Sanity Studio at `/studio` to edit content

### Option 2: Use Convex CMS
1. Run the Convex seed:
   ```bash
   npm run seed:cms
   ```

2. Access the admin panel at `/cms-admin`

3. Pages are already updated to use Convex content

## Current Status

- **preciseweb.vercel.app** - Live with CMS integration
- **preciseweb.vercel.app/studio** - Sanity Studio for content editing
- **preciseweb.vercel.app/cms-admin** - Alternative Convex admin panel
